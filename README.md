Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or using keyboard input. As a personal assistant, It assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in google, searching for files, emails etc, tracks your mood and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user statements/commands are analysed with the help of machine learning to give an optimal solution.
